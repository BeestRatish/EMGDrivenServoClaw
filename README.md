# EMGDrivenServoClaw
To use electromyography (EMG) to recognize electroactivity created by muscular movement. The claw will take the signal of the contracting arm or hand muscle to either open or close the claw. 

Description
	The EMG-Driven Claw project utilizes electromyography signals to control the operation of a mechanical claw. This project's approach is to take muscle activity signals and use those signals to operate the mechanical claw. The ability to have human-like movements by muscle activity can mimic human hand movements. The aim of the framework is to have the claw react to muscle signals in real time. This project can suggest a larger-scale implementation for humans with disabilities, injuries for paralysis, and hand and or arm amputees. 

Motivation
	The motivation behind this term project aligns with a more complex and technological advancement in aiding people with disabilities or who have lost limbs due to paralysis, injury, or neurological damage. These disabilities can impede a person's daily functional activities needed for survival. These activities include but are not limited to feeding, drinking, cleansing, grasping, and grabbing objects. The Claw is a low-level design used to become familiar with the basic understanding of Electromyography (EMG) sensors and how they relate to muscle movement, activities, and gestures.
